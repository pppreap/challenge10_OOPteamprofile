## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input:

WHEN  **the user is prompted for my team members and their information**
THEN an **HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input**

WHEN  the **user click on an email address in the HTML,**
THEN **the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.**

WHEN  **click on the GitHub username,**
THEN that **GitHub profile opens in a new tab.**

THEN  **prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.**

WHEN  the user **enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number,**
THEN  **presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.**

WHEN the user **select the engineer option,**
THEN  **prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.**
